    "# Business Insights\n",
    "- **Whole milk is central**: milk frequently appears in high-lift rules together with bakery items (e.g., rolls/buns) and yogurt — good target for point-of-sale cross-sells and bundled discounts.\n",
    "- **Meal combinations exist**: combinations like sausage + rolls/buns + whole milk suggest small meal or breakfast bundles that can be promoted together.\n",
    "- **Promotions strategy**: use high-confidence rules for store-wide placement (e.g., place common pairs closer), and high-lift rules (even if lower support) for targeted coupons or personalized offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use these rules (simple next steps):**\n",
    "1. Test a small bundle (milk + rolls) with a short coupon to measure lift in sales.\n",
    "2. Place complementary items near each other to increase impulsive pair purchases.\n",
    "3. Use targeted promotions (loyalty app or weekly flyer) for high-lift item pairs to raise average basket value.\n",
